# Dystopian West
## This is my first C# project, and the first game I made using the C# Monogame framework.

## What is this game?
It's a shooter game (with a buggy collision system...) I made for fun and to get into C# programming. You control a spaceship and avoid the asteroids.

## Things I may add in the future:
- Leaderboard (WIP)
- Proper menu (the current one was made just to experiment ðŸ¥² )
- Sound effects and music

### This project is not complete, with the main focus to get a hang of programming in C#. I have learnt much since :).
